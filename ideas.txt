If no .srt found dont reset to default slider position and so on
Remember last position of windows over next run
Change windows size in config (during run time?)
Remember last episode not debugging
Wrong episode when turning off?
Show Kanji written above
When changing episode maybe play button buggy(fixed?)
When using a film change the episode entry or something and change length of slider
Adjust slider depending on srt file
Add button in control window which shows settings window
When longer than 1 h resize control window and episode entry and change time entry
when movie (when not japanese characters) the width of subtitle window is wrong


Problems:
Only appearing control window when focus is on the subtitle window
if the offset is set to big or negative and so on the slider is not adjusted to this
