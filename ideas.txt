To Do:
add config for phone mode default true/false
change how everything is initialized when a new srt is loaded. Currently the subtitle window size is not recalculated.

Ideas:
Wrong episode when turning off?
Detect uncommon words or phrases and let users hover or tap a subtitle segment to 
    see an in-line glossary or translationâ€”great for educational content
Change windows size in config (during run time?)

Dont do:
Change subtitle width to fit current subtitle (maybe flashes --> YES)

Added:
Show Kanji written above
Add button in control window which shows settings window
When longer than 1 h resize control window and episode entry and change time entry
Remember last position of windows over to next run
Change control time entry size if movie and bigger time string



Fixed:
If no .srt found dont reset to default slider position and so on
when movie (when not japanese characters) the width of subtitle window is wrong
When phone mode button to show settigns window issue
if the offset is set to big or negative and so on the slider is not adjusted to this
